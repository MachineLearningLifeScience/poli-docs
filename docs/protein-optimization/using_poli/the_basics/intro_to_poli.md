# What is poli?

`poli` is a library for registering black box optimization functions, with a special focus on *discrete* sequence optimization. It stands for *Protein Optimization Library*, since some of the work done on drug design is done through representing proteins as discrete sequences, or sentences of amino acids.

We also build `poli-baselines` on top, allowing you to define black box optimization algorithms for discrete sequences.

These next chapters detail a basic example of how to use `poli` and `poli-baselines`. Continue to [the next chapter](./registering_an_objective_function.md)!

After these, feel free to dive deeper into how `poli` works underneath in [the chapter about the details](./diving_deeper.md).
