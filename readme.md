# Documentation for `poli` and `poli-baselines` ðŸ§ª

This repository contains a `jupyter-book` with documentation for `poli` and `poli-baselines`

## Building the documentation

The folder `./docs/poli-docs` is a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). To build it, create a new environment (`python>=3.10`) and install the requirements:

```bash
conda create -n poli-docs python=3.10
conda activate poli-docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Manual

These docs are a `jupyter-book`, which runs using Sphinx.

### Adding a new black box

If you are adding a new black box to the docs, you can start by copying one of the `.md` files inside `docs/poli-docs/using_poli/objective_repository` and modifying it accordingly.

After you are happy with the contents of your markdown file, you have to:
- add it to the `_toc.yml` file.
- add it to the `index.md` as one more cell in the relevant section.

### Adding a new optimizer

Similarly to black boxes, you can add solvers by going to `docs/poli-docs/using_poli_baselines`, duplicating one of the files and modifying it accordingly.

Once you're done, you have to:
- add it to the `_toc.yml` file.
- add it to the `index.md` as one more cell in the relevant section.

## Adding relevant files to the `_toc.yml`

If you're building a new page, it's quite likely you'll have to add a new entry to the relevant section of `_toc.yml`.

## (Maybe) Adding mock dependencies to the `_config.yml`

If you're implementing a new black box, it is likely that some pages won't build in the API if the right dependencies are not installed for `poli`. Add mock dependencies in the `_config.yml` to prevent this.

## Building

After this, you can build the documentation using

```bash
jupyter-book build --all docs/poli-docs
```

## Deployment

Since we are relying on building the website locally (because of `foldx` dependencies), you will need to

1. `pip install ghp-import`
2. run `ghp-import -n -p -f ./docs/poli-docs/_build/html`
